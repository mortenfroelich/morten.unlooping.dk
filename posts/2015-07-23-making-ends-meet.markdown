So its the day after my 30Th birthday. Did I wake up wise and grown up? Not to my knowledge but I did wake up to a house full of snot monsters including yours truly. One of our little viral friends has managed to take down first Anton and Laura, jump on to Amanda and then finish off by attacking me and on my birthday too! Where we got it from is any ones bet.  Both kids are just starting out in the germ incubator (aka. daycare) and Lauras colleague has been working through a nasty infection to finish her thesis. All in all there is plenty sources of infection, that much is clear.

However my pounding head does allow me, atleast right now, to sit down and reflect a bit which seems fitting after entering my 4Th decade of life.

So what is happening with my current [challenge](../challenge.html)? Well it has been the one thing that I consistently have managed to get done. I have even managed to keep the status up to date with my progress. After starting backup at work my free time has decreased to a very low level and putting in the 1-2 hours of Kanji practice has been difficult. But somehow I have managed to get them done most days and with *only* 360 kanji to go the end seems within reach. Aside from a bit of Pimsleur in the car and some passive listening that has been the only Japanese I have managed to cram into my schedule. The important point however is that I am actually getting it done and it that regard I am very pleased with the motivational power of this challenge. I am already thinking about how to formulate the next challenge so that it fits into my schedule, is measurable while still being a challenge. I am pretty certain that the focus will once again be Japanese hopefully inching me closer to actually being able to understanding real Japanese media.

I could probably reflect more on the whole turning 30 thing and besides things in general being pretty fine my head is so stuffy that it is hard to put coherent thoughts together so that will have to be another day.
