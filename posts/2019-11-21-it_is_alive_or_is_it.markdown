description: Very short post about this blog being back up.

Not much to say, its been what 5 years? I can't really comprehend that but thanks to Azure and me
fooling around with a docker hakyll image it looks like this blog is back in action.

I will endevour to make a post about how this was setup but it is too late now for that.

In short much of this blog is probably out of date and needs a good house cleaning but now it
is online at least.
