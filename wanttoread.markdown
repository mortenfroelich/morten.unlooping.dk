title: Want to Read
description: List of content that I would like consume at some point.

Simply a long list of stuff I need to get around to reading.

It should probably be split into several pages and a separate one created for books.

In no semblance of order:

### Books ###

Currently reading:

- Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman
    - Enjoyable, if somewhat repetitive (which is probably intentional), insight into the foibles of intuition.
- Learn Windows PowerShell 3 in a Month of Lunches by Don Jones and Jeffery Hicks
    - I've been using powershell haphazardly for work for a couple years now but hopefully this book will make it possible to remove some of the hacks I've pieced together while fumbling with it.
- CLR via C# 4th edition by Jeffrey Richter (currently a bit on standby)
    - Slow reading but great insights a bit deeper into C# and CLR
- City of Dragons, Volume Three of the Rain Wilds Chronicles by Robin Hobb
    - Borrowed from by brother in law, I've enjoyed most of her books and this one looks like it is cut from the same cloth.
